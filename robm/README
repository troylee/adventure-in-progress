1. The code works with Matlab 7 + image processing toolbox

2. The training algorithm in robm_learn.m makes use of the "Zero-mean" trick 
	as detailed in:
	@TechReport{TangS11,
	 author = {Yichuan Tang and Ilya Sutskever},
	 title = {Data Normalization in the Learning of Restricted Boltzmann Machines},
	 institution =  "Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto",
	 year = {2011},
	 type = 	"Technical Report",
	 number =	"UTML-TR-11-2",
	}

3. The Yale Face Database was originally from:
http://cvc.yale.edu/projects/yalefaces/yalefaces.html
However, it does not seem to be available at this time. A zip file of 
cropped faces used in experiments is included. 
You should unzip it into the root folder.

4. An already trained GRBM (on clean yale faces) is included in yale_grbm.mat

5. Run robm_demo.m
